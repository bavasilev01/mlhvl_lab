        "\n",
        "So far, we have seen how word vectors can be constructed from corpus statistics, and how they can be utilized to infer latent semantic content either in isolation (e.g. genders from names) or in relation to one another (e.g. similarities and analogies).\n",
        "\n",
        "For tasks involving larger linguistic units such as phrases, sentences and dialogues, we need machinery capable of processing _sequences_ or _structures_ of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are an example of such machinery. For this assignment, you will construct a recurrent neural network that will predict properties of the upcoming (not yet seen) text. You know this situation from language models, which try to predict the next word in a sequence given context. What language models do is provide a conditional probability distribution over the whole vocabulary of the upcoming word. Here, however, we will simplify our life. Rather than trying to predict the upcoming word, **we will construct a recurrent neural network that will predict the part-of-speech tag (POS tag) of the upcoming word.** That is, the network will build a conditional probability distribution over the full list of POS tags of the upcoming word given the preceding context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's look at a few examples to make it clear what the model will be doing and to gauge intuion on how difficult this is. Sometimes, the task can be fairly easy. For instance, if the sentence starts as 'I want to...' then the next POS tag (the POS tag of the next word given this context) is very likely to be a verb in its base form (e.g., 'sleep'). Other times, it is harder. For instance, if the context is 'John left...' the continuation could be almost any POS tag, from the period (which has its own tag) to a preposition (as in 'John left at noon') through pronouns (as in 'John left us') to determiners (as in 'John left the city').\n",
        "\n",
        "This task can be seen as simplified case of using an RNN as a language model. A good reference point for RNNs as language models and for RNNs as labellers of POS tags is in Jurafsky and Martin [Chapter 8](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/8.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "You might wonder why anyone would bother modeling such prediction. One reason is that the resulting model can be seen as approximating human behavior, in this case, human behavior in reading and listening. It is a well-known fact that when we process text (or speech), we do not just passively wait for the incoming information. We are immediately interpreting and we predict what will be coming next. This prediction has various levels of abstraction: we might predict concrete words, but we also predict abstract properties of such words, such as gender or their phonological structures. The task that you do here can be seen as one step in this prediction process. We will try to see whether the resulting RNN model is in any way similar to humans.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will take a gradual approach, first inspecting recurrent neural networks, then moving on to data processing using high-grade word vectors before finally moving to the problem at hand.\n",

If we used these data for our model as it is, the model would not predict a tag based on the preceding words, but it would do a simple sequence POS-tag labelling (see Jurafsky and Martin [Chapter 8](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/8.pdf) for sequence labelling).\n",
